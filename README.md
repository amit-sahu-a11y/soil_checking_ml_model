# 🌱 Soil Checking Machine Learning Model

A Machine Learning model that analyzes soil properties to classify soil type or predict its fertility. This tool can help farmers, agronomists, and researchers in making informed agricultural decisions.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build an ML model that predicts the type or quality of soil using features like:
- pH level
- Moisture content
- Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- Soil texture or color (if applicable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for training & evaluation)

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest *(Choose yours)*
- **Input Features:** Soil nutrients, pH, moisture
- **Output:** Soil type or fertility rating
